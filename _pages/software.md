# Software

## DPPy

I am the main developer of the [DPPy](https://github.com/guilgautier/DPPy) Python toolbox [(Determinantal Point Processes with Python, G., Polito, Bardenet and Valko, JMLR-MLOSS, 2019)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/publications.md %}/#journal-articles).
Take a look at the [documentation](https://dppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) to know more and play with both discrete and continuous Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs)!

## PartialRejectionSampling.jl

I am the main developer of the [PartialRejectionSampling.jl](https://github.com/guilgautier/PartialRejectionSampling.jl) Julia toolbox.
Partial Rejection Sampling (PRS) is a pretty new methodology developed by [Guo, Jerrum, and Liu (2019) ](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3310131) to generate exact samples from product distributions subject to some constraints, see e.g., some graph and spatial point processes.
Take a look at the [documentation](https://guilgautier.github.io/PartialRejectionSampling.jl/dev/) to know more about it.
